# 5-1: The Shopping of the Lambs

In this festive holiday assignment, we implement a model of Black Friday
madness based on the concurrency concepts of C++11.

A customer (thread) performs the following procedure:

- Stand in line and try to enter a shopping center
- When customers waited longer than T milliseconds, they try to enter
  any other shopping center
- On entry, customers randomly grab products and leave when they have
  acquired at least one product they cannot afford the next product.
