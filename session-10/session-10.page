# Fundamental Formal Definitions Revisited

## Semantics

Originating from linguistics, semantics is the study of meaning.
Formal means to represent semantics is a necessity as intuitive reasoning is obviously
biased and may drastically differ between individuals.

In the context of this course, and actually computer science in general, formal
semantics describe the effect of operations and their interoperability and
interdependency with respect to the scope of their invocation.

We usually specify:

- Preconditions
- Invariants
- Postconditions


## Concept

Similar the *Ideon* in Platon's terminology, a concept (lat. *conceptum* - sth. perceived) is an abstract idea representing fundamental characteristics.
In C++, concepts are used to define an ontology of types.
