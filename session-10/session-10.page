# Move Semantics

## Move-only Types

Types that only provide move construction and move assignment and forbid any
other instantiation method are called *move-only types*.
In effect, a move-only object, and in effect its resources, cannot be cloned
to another owner or shared between objects.

## unique_ptr

`std::unique_ptr` maintains exclusive ownership semantics.
A non-null `std::unique_ptr` always owns what it points to. Consequently, copying it
must be forbidden as all owners would assume exclusive access to the encapsulated
object.
It is therefore a move-only type: moving a `std::unique_ptr` transfers ownership
from the source pointer to the destination pointer.
