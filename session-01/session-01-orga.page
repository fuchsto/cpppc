## VM Image

VM system is headless (without GUI), so you should login via SSH:

- Open the file CppPC.vbox in VirtualBox.
- In the Settings tab, enable network adapter 2 under Network and set it to Host-only Adapter. \
  Ensure that Cable Connected is checked in the Advanced section of the network adapter configuration.
- Adjust number of CPUs and RAM size in the System tab.
- Start the virtual machine.
- Login as user root (Password: crunch123) and enter ifconfig to list the system's IP addresses.
- Connect to the IP listed for interface enp0s08 via SSH as user cpppc (password: crunch123).

Messing around with user accounts or the system will not be considered a laughing matter. \
Be responsible and respectful to others.

Now, please test your account. The following build should run without errors:

~~~bash

~~~
      
If you think there is something wrong with your account configuration (such as ZSH or (n)vim), run:

~~~bash
$ /opt/reset-home.sh # Confirm with 'y' and ENTER
$ /opt/init-home.sh
~~~
