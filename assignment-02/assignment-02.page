# 2-0: Prerequisites

## 2-0-1: Iterator Concepts


- Make yourself familiar with the `Iterator` concepts in the STL: \
  [http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/Iterator]()
- What are the differences between the concepts `ForwardIterator` and
  `RandomAccessIterator`?
- What are the differences between the concepts `InputIterator` and
  `OutputIterator`?


## 2-0-2: Sequence Container Concept

Sequence containers implement data structures which can be accessed sequentially.
Methods `begin()` and `end()` define the iteration space of the container elements.

- Make yourself familiar with *Sequence Container* concept defined in the STL: \
  [http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/SequenceContainer]()

**Excerpt**:

Type                            | Synopsis
------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------
`typename      value_type`      | the container's element type `T`
`typename        iterator`      | iterator type referencing a container element
`typename  const_iterator`      | typically defined as `const iterator`
`typename       reference`      | type definition for `value_type &`
`typename const_reference`      | type definition for `const value_type &`


Signature                       | Synopsis
------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------
`iterator begin()            .` | iterator referencing the first element in the \
                                  container or `end()` if container is empty
`const_iterator begin()  const` | const iterator referencing the first element in the \
                                  container or `end()` if container is empty
`iterator end()              .` | iterator referencing past the final element in \
                                  the container
`const_iterator end()    const` | const iterator referencing past the final element in \
                                  the container
`size_type size()        const` | number of elements in the container, same as \
                                  `end() - begin()`


# 2-1: The Measurements\<T\> Class Template

Assuming you run a series of benchmarks, each returning a measurement.
At the end of the test series, the mean, median, standard deviation (sigma) and
variance should be printed.

Implement the class template `Measurements<T>` representing a sequence container
that allows to collect measurement data as single values and provides methods to
obtain the mean, median, standard deviation and variance of the container elements.


## Measurements Container Concept

In addition to the Sequence Container Concept:

Signature                       | Synopsis
------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------
`T median()             const ` | returns the median of the elements in the container \
                                  or `0` if the container is empty.
`double mean()          const ` | returns the mean of the elements in the container
`double variance()      const ` | returns the population variance of the elements in \
                                  the container
`double sigma()         const ` | returns the standard deviation of the elements in \
                                  the container


## Example:

~~~c++
Measurements<int> m1;
m1.insert(10);
m1.insert(34);

m1.size(); // = 2

Measurements<double> m2;
std::vector<double> v({ 36, 37, 10 });
m2.insert(v.begin(), v.end());

m1.insert(m2.begin(), m2.end())

m1.size(); // = 5

int    median = m1.median();
double mean   = m1.mean();
double sdev   = m1.sigma();
double var    = m1.variance();
~~~

Define a class template `Measurements<T>` that satisfies the Sequence Container
concept ([http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/SequenceContainer]()) and the
Measurements Container concept defined above.

You may ignore the `emplace` methods for now.

The solution uses `std::vector` as a starting point, but you may use any underlying
data structure in your implementation of `cpppc::Measurements<T>`.


# 2-X: Improve Efficiency

- Refactor your implementation of `Measurements<T>` such that all methods in the
  *Measurements* concept maintain constant computational complexity $O(c)$
- There are arithmetic solutions, possibly at the cost of numeric stability, and
  approaches focusing on the underlying data structure

## Hints

- Just for fun, have a look at
  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#Rapid_calculation_methods]()
- Review trustworthy (!) references for **multi-index containers**
- DrDobbs is a very trustworthy reference
