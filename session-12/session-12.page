# System Models




## Identifying Logical Components

Describe the system in simple statements, for example:
  
  > "The ADC measures surface voltage"

Now identify the following roles in your description.
In the most simple case, you can directly derive:

  - Subjects: Components ("ADC")
  - Predicates: Operations, Actions ("measures")
  - Objects: Message payload, operation arguments ("surface voltage")

## System Interfaces

  In principle, you are looking for senders and recipients of messages.
  So for example:

  > "The heartbeat detection emits an event if a QRS complex has been found in
  >  a voltage data window"

  - Component: Heartbeat detection
  - In: voltage data
  - Out: QRS event

## Identifying Subsystems

Every system has an interface consisting of its ingres and egres connections.
Just like a function interface: `double component(int n, complex c)`.

Group components by functional categories into subsystems, for example

  - ADC, Gyroscope -> Sensor Subsystem
  - Heartbeat detection -> Feature Extraction Subsystem

A subsystems input is the union of its component inputs.
