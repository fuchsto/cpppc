# 0: Prerequisites


# 1: The Tree\<T\> Class Template

Definition of the `Tree` concept:

Signature               | Synopsis
----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------
`ci insert_below(ni,v)` | insert value `v` as child of node referenced by iterator `nit`\
                          returns: iterator referencing the new child node
`sz size()`             | total number of nodes in the tree



# 2: Policies

## 2-1: Iteration Policy for Tree\<T\>

Implement **depth-first search** and **breadth-first-search** as policies used in
`Tree::iterator` types.


## 2-2: Allocation Policy for Tree\<T\>


## 2-X: Cache-Optimized Allocation

Allocation policy where sub-trees of a specific size are stored in blocks of
contiguous memory.
